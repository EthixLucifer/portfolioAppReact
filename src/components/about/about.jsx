                <p className="a-sub">I'm a coder who spends my days writing code, reading about Cyber-security, and working on side projects that teach me new things. I enjoy building and tinkering with different ideas in order to see how they work and what I can learn from them.

                    So, enough of this Ethix, my real name is Rohit Jambhulkar. I recently completed my three-year diploma in information technology with a 90% aggregate. Diploma pass-out students are taught industry-related subjects that make them industry-ready even before they take admissions in Engineering.<br></br>

                    <br></br>When I received my results and started to prepare a list of colleges I wanted to apply to, a sudden thought popped up in my mind quoting, <i>"Yaar, everyone does engineering; shouldn't I do something different."</i> Therefore, instead of taking admission in engineering for three continuous years (lateral entry) learning subjects with outdated curriculam, I decided to dedicate that time to improving on a skill I'm already good at.<br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    As a result I am currently a blockchain developer creating project smart contracts and applying my cybersecurity knowledge to make smart contracts secure. Blockchain is already changing how the internet works, and I surely donâ€™t want to miss this opportunity of becoming part of the internet evolution.

                            I'm a Solidity programmer specializing in the smart contract language for Ethereum. I am learning to develop web applications and D-apps using React.js and connect smart contracts using web3.js. I use Kali Linux tools to find vulnerabilities and possible exploits in Web Apps. With my hobby in technical content writing, I love to deliver simplified write-ups on complex topics.
